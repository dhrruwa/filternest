## 📋 Architecture Comparison

### BEFORE (Monolithic)
```
❌ Single frontend for all roles
❌ Large bundle size (~1.2MB)
❌ Mixed components and logic
❌ Harder to maintain
❌ Difficult to scale individual apps
❌ Role-mixing in single codebase
```

### AFTER (Multi-Frontend SaaS)
```
✅ Three independent frontends
✅ Smaller bundle sizes (~350-500KB each)
✅ Clean separation by role
✅ Easier to maintain
✅ Can scale each app independently
✅ Clear role boundaries
✅ Professional SaaS structure
```
